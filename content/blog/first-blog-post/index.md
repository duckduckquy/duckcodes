Hi, I am

```javascript
const person = {
    name : 'Duc-Quy Nguyen',
    age : 24,
    work : 'Leverege (Internet of Things)',
    hobbies : [ 'reading', 'cooking', 'ultimate frisbee'],
    languages : [ 'Javascript', 'SQL']
}

```

In April 2020, I started to learn how to code. Duckcodes is my blog following my journey to becoming a developer.
Along the way I hope to share what I am learning, silly mistakes I have made, and what I am building.

Coding is hard, but coding can also be fun~

Oh, and I also started a [Youtube Channel!](https://www.google.com)
